The implementation of an ATM system is built using Java. This code prioritizes security and user experience while offering a range of functionalities:

✨ Card Validation: Ensures only valid debit cards can access the system.
✨ PIN Verification: Protects user accounts with a secure PIN validation process, including attempt limits for incorrect PIN entries.
✨ Operator Mode: Grants authorized personnel access to monitor ATM activities, deposit cash, reset user PIN attempts, and check the ATM machine balance.
✨ User Transactions: Allows customers to withdraw cash, deposit funds, check their account balance, change their PIN, and view mini-statements.
✨ Exception Handling: Implements robust error handling for various scenarios like invalid cards, insufficient balance, incorrect PIN entries, and exceeding ATM machine capacity.

 This code provides a solid foundation for building a comprehensive ATM system. It can be further customized to integrate with real-world banking systems

 This Java code simulates a basic ATM system, handling various operations like card validation, PIN verification, withdrawals, deposits, balance inquiries, PIN changes, and operator-level functionalities.
